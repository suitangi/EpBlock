Epilepsy Blocker

EpBlock is a program designed to assist epileptic computer users by blocking out dangerous visual stimuli. EpBlocker samples the computer's visual data at a high rate and opens a window to protect you from flashing lights and other strobe effects. The EpBlock team hopes that EpBlock will allow you to browse the web without fear of an epileptic fit. If you have questions, comments, or concerns, please contact the team at EpBlocker@gmail.com.
